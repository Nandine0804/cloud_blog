## Project Summary

This project deploys a Django-based blog application on AWS, utilizing services like EC2, RDS, S3, DynamoDB, CloudFront, and Route 53. The result is a scalable, secure web app where users can upload media to S3, with metadata stored in DynamoDB. Key components include VPC, IAM for security, SSL via AWS Certificate Manager, and CloudFront for content delivery. Security measures involve IAM roles, encryption, VPC isolation, and compliance with GDPR. The project emphasizes thorough monitoring with CloudWatch, and overcomes challenges like EC2 health checks and DynamoDB sync issues. Continuous improvement includes enhanced security and automated deployment with CodePipeline.
